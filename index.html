		<p>This isn’t  a riddle but I’m going to ask you this anyways – What do you get when you cross a chocolate chip cookie with a brownie? Otherwise known as – BROOKIES. Combining the forces of an all-time favourite classic brownie and chocolate chip cookie is not only a match made in “BAR” heaven but it guarantees the best of both worlds.</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
			<li>Spray a 9X13 pan with non-stick cooking spray or line with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
			<h4>For the brownie layer</h4>
			<li>Stir sugar, eggs, and vanilla into the melted butter. Stir in the cocoa, flour, salt, and baking powder by hand. Just until combined, don’t over mix.</li>
			<li>Pour the brownie batter evenly onto the bottom of the 9X13 pan.</li>
			<h4>For the cookie layer</h4>
			<li>Beat the sugars, butter, and vanilla together until creamy with a hand mixer.  Add in the egg and mix again until incorporated.</li>
			<li>Then stir in by hand the baking powder, salt and flour.  Do not over mix.  Slowly fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
			<li>Drop spoonfuls of the cookie dough on top of the brownie batter.  Spread as evenly as you can but it won’t cover the top completely.</li>
			<li> Bake for 25-28 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean and the cookie dough on top is golden brown.</li>
			<li>Allow to cool completely, then cut and enjoy!</li>
